- My name is Paul.
- I'm the main curator of the ICPics collection. 
- I am primarily a data scientist by vocation with proficiency in AI, Machine learning, and adaptive systems. 
- I am also a published academic economist specializing in the field of development economics. 
- It has a long passion of mine to showcase the richness of different ethnic cultures around the world, its people and its places. 
- This, coupled with my recent trust in cryptospace, NFTs, and the ICP ecosystem, I am bringing you the project of ICPics - Gen 0 collection.
- So, there you have it... browse around and enjoy!
